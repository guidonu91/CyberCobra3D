The CYBER COBRA 3D game consists of guiding a snake designed in 3D across the terrain of the game. Avoid colliding with walls, obstacles and the snake's own body. The goal is to get the most points by eating the fruits that are placed on the board. The body of the snake is increasing according to the amount of fruit eaten.

The game is developed in C and OpenGL as a project for the University.
